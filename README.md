This repository is used to record the Java solutions of Algorithms for SWE interviews

Hi Friends,

Since I only have 4 years experience in Java, I am not 100% sure my solutions are best, but at least they work. So just take a look and if it could bring some hints to you, it will be nice.

I will also add some explanation for some solutions to help you understand it. I will also try to add time and space complexity analysis.

Hope you could find your dream job and enjoy coding
